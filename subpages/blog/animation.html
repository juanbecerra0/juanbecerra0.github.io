                                One of the most important components of 3D game development happens to also be one of the most
                                overlooked by the layman: animation state development. This single aspect of development does
                                not only play into the overall aesthetics of a game, but it also plays a heavy part in gameplay
                                and information presentation. For example, a fighting game may allow the player to chain
                                together inputs in order to perform combos, and a game’s system will need to smoothly transition
                                between different key frames in order to let the player know that these attacks were correctly
                                performed. In a more adventure-oriented genre, a player’s current running velocity, terrain, and
                                stamina state may all play a roll on the final running pose at any given point. To say that
                                handling these animation states would eventually get complex would be a massive understatement.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This aspect of game design may initially seem trivial but imagine this scenario: you’re playing
                                your favorite action-oriented adventure game. You’re running through a grass plain, but
                                something seems off. No matter how you modify the speed of your character and no matter the size
                                of the rocks that your character must assumedly maneuver, the running animation remains static.
                                You press the ‘pickup’ input in order to reach out and pick up a flower, but instead your
                                character reaches directly out in front of you and grasps at air, all while your character is
                                moving without moving their legs. There is a distinct disconnect between the player’s
                                inputs/desired actions and how the game affirms the performance of these actions.

                                A screenshot of The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, specifically from a game modification that seeks to
                                add and improve animation transitions from the base game

                                Simply put, animation state development is difficult. As the verbiage of a game grows, the
                                amount of distinct animation states and transitions between them grows exponentially. In
                                addition, there are tons of circumstances that each animation state may have to consider and
                                consequently modify their poses. However, fairly recent advancements in game engine development
                                may mean that these aspects may become easier to develop for. In this blog post, I’ll be
                                introducing the concept of utilizing neural networks and machine learning in order to
                                efficiently develop animation state locomotion for a variety of player scenarios.
                            </p>
        
                            <h2 style="color:white;">A Primer</h2>
                            <p>
                                Game engines and development tools all handle animation state machines differently, but in
                                general, they follow this workflow: import a rigged model and a large set of animations
                                (typically done iteratively by artists using specialized modeling software), create a discrete
                                set of animation states (such as idle, running, jumping, attacks, etc.), create transitions
                                between these states (for example, idle or jumping can transition to jumping via input), and
                                cleaning (ensure that the transitions between states is smoothly interpolated, account for
                                compound states like being able to run from the waist down and attack from the waist up, and
                                utilize physics constraints for stuff like the shock absorption after a jump or foot placement
                                in idle and running). In addition, any given state can have its own independent state machine
                                within it, so in a way, the overall state machine acts as a sort of hierarchy of pose
                                information. Whenever a new state is introduced, these steps will often need to be redone for a
                                large portion of existing states. For example, if a ‘pickup’ animation is introduced, you may
                                need to specify that it can only be performed while idle or running, may be done in compound
                                with the aforementioned states, and may utilize physics constraints to reach for the target
                                object, which may deform the legs, back, and arms as well.

                                Now I want to reaffirm why an easier, machine-learning-oriented approach may be necessary. As
                                previously mentioned, as more verbs are introduced into the game prototype, the complexity of
                                these animation states will grow exponentially. Say we wanted to add more verbs and special
                                transitions, such as crawling, siding, run-jumping, and ledge-hanging. In this case, we’d end up
                                with a state machine that’s quite a bit more involved:

                                On the surface, this is already starting to become difficult to manage with several arrows
                                pointing to many discrete states. This does not even display information regarding physics
                                constraints, the circumstances for state transitions to occur, the interpolation between
                                different states, and the delta time between state transitions. Now imagine adding a simple
                                ‘pick-up’ state. Now you need to ask how can other states transition between it, if the action
                                can be compounded with other states, if it can be interrupted by certain events (such as falling
                                or taking damage), and how to seamlessly blend into this state. It’s doable, but it would surely
                                take a lot of human authoring and trial and error in order to accomplish. For this reason, we
                                have a motivation to try other solutions, such as machine learning.

                            <h2 style="color:white;">Applying Machine Learning</h2>
                            <p>
                                So we’ve seen the general workflow of how discrete animation states are hand-authored. Now how
                                does machine learning fit into all of this? For this, I will primarily be referencing from a GDC
                                (Game Developer’s Conference) talk by Ubisoft’s Daniel Holden in which he explains, at a high
                                level, how their engine handles animation authoring for game series like Watch Dogs and
                                Assassin’s Creed. In addition, I will be referencing an article from Neurohive for high-level
                                implementation details. Links to both can be found in the ‘References’ section.

                                This first step of this system is to compartmentalize the flow of how animation is simulated. At
                                a high level, player input and gameplay information is sent into a black-box animation system,
                                which then outputs a final animation pose for any given frame in a game’s simulation.

                                At a high level, the neural network animation system will work in three distinct components:
                                separate data, specific desired variables, and generalize solution.
                            </p>
        
                            <h2 style="color:white;">Data Seperation</h2>
                            <p>
                                In a typical animation state machine, states will contain a distinct animation or pose along
                                with any necessary information for blending and physics constraints. However, for this approach,
                                we want to separate this data out based on certain tags (such as male, idle, tired, etc.) rather
                                than long descriptors (male_idle_tired vs. male_idle_energetic). Ideally, these tags would be
                                the same among many states, except for unique poses, such as ones shown in cutscenes. These tags
                                allow us to tie states to gameplay elements (such as velocity constraints and attack states). In
                                the long run, this makes maintaining large state machines easier as it scales as we can simply
                                describe desired states rather than trying to author large state machines.

                                Once our animation system can be treated as a database with a tag system for querying final
                                poses, we can start defining variables. For example, we may have a large pool of animations that
                                match simple running locomotion. When inserted into a database, these running animations can be
                                tagged based on different constraints, gameplay scenarios, and user input. At runtime,
                                animations can be cycled through based on what constraints fit the best (such as player
                                character information, current speed, the delta between current and desired running directions,
                                materials under the player’s feet, and information regarding recent poses). The graphic below
                                shows how this system can find the best animation given the current simulated constraints.

                                Attempting to match multiple constraints to a constantly growing database of poses can be very
                                costly, especially given that we’re working with a game that must maintain an acceptable
                                framerate at runtime. Thankfully, the aforementioned setup is a great candidate for a
                                neural-network based solution. In the end, we are trying to map out these constraints to
                                animations in input-output pairs, which can be solved using a subset of machine learning known
                                as “supervised learning”. This process of predicting a continuous outcome variables based on an
                                input is known as “regression” (or “nearest neighbor regression” since we’re working with
                                multiple mapped variables).

                            <h2 style="color:white;">Neural Network Based Solution</h2>
                            <p>
                                This system as is works reasonably well for developing somewhat seamless poses. Given a large
                                animation database and some blending between animation transitions, we get decent results with
                                reasonable time and memory complexity (~1 ms and ~200 mb in Ubisoft’s case). However, final
                                poses tend to have a strange “jitteriness” in transition in addition to occasional jarring
                                poses. For many projects, bringing it to this step may be considered good enough. However,
                                applying the neural-net based solution to our regression could yield more aesthetically pleasing
                                results.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Unfortunately, neural-networks aren’t a simple “plug-and-play solution”. Final poses will rely
                                heavily based on the representation of inputs and outputs, and how the system actually decides
                                to output interpolated poses. For example, if the player were to step forward from an idle pose,
                                a system will need to decide whether to step with the left or right foot first, but a naïve
                                implementation may end up choosing to step with a blend of both, resulting in even more jarring
                                locomotion than our previous solution. Because of this, we’ll need a way to solve this ambiguity
                                in our system using a system of “bins” and “phases”.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                A phase can be defined as some sort of slice in a cycle of animation locomotion. For example, a
                                step with the left foot can represent 0, a step with a right foot can represent pi, and
                                returning to the left foot can represent 2*pi. Along these phases, several animation poses can
                                be placed into discrete “bins”, which contain several viable candidates for a pose at any given
                                moment.

                                Once this setup is complete, the system only needs two things: training and human judgement. The
                                system can now train on random gameplay and simulated input constraints, which in turn develops
                                key pathways for selecting animation poses. Once a large set of data is trained, humans (likely
                                artists and designers) will need to review the generated locomotion, and decide on how neural
                                network variables should be shifted to yield aesthetically pleasing results.

                                The final results are fairly staggering. In Ubisoft’s results, they can bake an animation state
                                machine with either (1 ms / 10 mb) or (0.5ms / 100 mb) response times and memory usage
                                respectively. In addition, the results tend to almost always be more aesthetically pleasing than
                                the previous non-neural-net, regression-based solution as this also accounts for human
                                judgement.

                                In conclusion, machine learning-driven animation development has the potential to revolutionize
                                how animation state machines are developed. More specifically, it proves itself to be an
                                extremely valuable asset in large AAA video games, where traditional animation state machines
                                can grow exponentially in complexity. While it does require developers to learn while new skill
                                sets and give up, to some degree, precise control of animation states, it allows developers to
                                save time in animation development which, in turn, allows them to work on other important
                                aspects of development.
